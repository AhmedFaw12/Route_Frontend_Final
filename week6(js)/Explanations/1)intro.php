Introduction:
    -creator of javascript take features from 3 programming languages:
        -java
        -scheme
        -self
    
    -At first javascript was named: Livescript
    -then its named changed and became javascript
    -then it became ECMASript
    -javascript is a commercial name
    -in standarization , it is called ECMASript

    -versions of ECMAScript are called (ES1, ES2, .... , ES6,...)
    -new versions of ECMAScript after ES6 are called (ES6 0r ESnext or ES+)
    -ECMAScript is standarization name of javascript

    -some old versions of browsers may not support ES6 and what is next, so we will get a converter to convert to ES5
    

    Javascript uses:
        -javascript/ecmascript can't take to database directly:
            - we will convert database to apis(application programming interface)
            - give APIs to javascript
        -javascript deals with interactions(scroll, click, .. )
        -javascript deals with browser(url , ...)
        -javascript make DOM(document object model)(html code) and BOM(browser)(deal with browser)
        -javascript make validation
        -javascript is a programming language
