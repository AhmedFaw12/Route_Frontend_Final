Semantic Tags:

        -Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

        -A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

        -Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

        -Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

        Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

        In HTML5 there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
            <article>:

            <aside>
            <details>
            <figcaption> :caption of figure
            <figure> : contain img
            <footer> 
            <header>
            <main>
            <mark>
            <nav>
            <section>
            <summary>
            <time>
        
        -they are used same way as div 
        -they made these tags for SEO(search engine optimization)
